And with an infinite canvas inside of your application, there are some very real challenges with guiding the user\u2019s focus and attention.

With the shift to mobile, there is an increasing need to fight spam in that space. However, traditional CAPTCHAs are not well suited for mobile form factors. In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This \u201cNo CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA\u201d dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic \u201cNo CAPTCHA\u201d followed by an interactive codelab to implement reCAPTCHA on your mobile site.

The discovery starts with the use of voice input via a single button press on the remote. Google search and voice recognition makes the search a powerful experience. As an app developer, you can further enrich such a search experience and drive users to your app by integrating with search in two ways, marking up your website or implementing Android APIs.

With the shift to mobile, there is an increasing need to fight spam in that space. However, traditional CAPTCHAs are not well suited for mobile form factors. In response, the reCAPTCHA team recently launched a completely reimagined API that lets users pass the CAPTCHA test with just a single click. This \u201cNo CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA\u201d dramatically simplifies the mobile user experience. In this talk we will discuss the technology behind the magic \u201cNo CAPTCHA\u201d followed by an interactive codelab to implement reCAPTCHA on your mobile site.
